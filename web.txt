The internet is a vast array of interconnected devices, all connected together via wired and wireless connections. Your local network is generally just your devices like your phone, computer and router. Your router is a special type of computer made to handle and send requests to and from the correct recipients, it connects to another device at your ISP which allows your requests to be routed around the world to get you outside information. When you make a request by cliking on a link your computer first makes a request to a DNS, or Domain Name Resolution, server and sends it the url you are requesting. This DNS then finds the correct IP address associated with that URL after bouncing the connection through another few IP addresses (usually) and sends you back the IP address to connect to. Your computer can then send GET and POST requests and otherwise interact with the server normally.
